              <p>This is a really interesting book. It teaches you about laws that are essential to not only use but protect you from other people in the realm of power.</p>

              <p>This novel was published recently so I enjoyed it a lot in that the things that the characters face in their school are things that I have seen in real life; so you’re able to relate a lot to what the novel talks about.</p>

              <a href=https://jarycruz.substack.com/p/just-mercy" target="_blank"><h5>Review: Just Mercy</h5></a>
              <p>This was a really impacting book for me. It exposes the horrible cruelties of the current justice system. Before reading this book, I assumed that the justice system worked just fine, but after reading it, I’m extremely surprised by how it is misused and imposed on minorities & innocent people.</p>

              <a href="https://jarycruz.substack.com/p/malcom-x" target="_blank"><h5>Review: The Autobiography of Malcom-X</h5></a>
              <p>I absolutely loved this book. I think his story is a fascinating one to read because it goes through so many turns, so many changes, so many controversies, and so many great moments. There are a lot of mistakes, there are a lot of successes, and it’s also a very educational book.</p>

              <p>This book was the very first memoir that I ever read. It really surprised me how much I enjoyed reading Maya Angelou. She explains everything in a sort of child-like way that makes the book feel like you’re almost reading fiction.</p>

              <a href="https://jarycruz.substack.com/p/flow" target="_blank"><h5>Review: Flow</h5></a>
              <p>Flow explores the question of what motivates people in a clear and fascinating way. This shaped the way I see the things that I do every day and allowed me to have a different perception of how to achieve happiness.</p>
